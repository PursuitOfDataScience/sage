## Private Software 

All users can install software packages privately in their home and project directories in accordance with the [RCC Terms of Use](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/about-rcc/rcc-user-policy). Users can compile and install software while connected to the login nodes unless the process is time- or memory-consuming. In such cases, it is recommended to use **compute nodes**, however note that compute nodes do not have access to the internet. Please check our documentation on how to start and use a `sinteractive` session [here](../slurm/sinteractive.md). 

## Shared Software

RCC uses [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net){:target='_blank'} for managing software packages and libraries that would otherwise conflict with one another. 

When you first log into RCC clusters, you will be entered into a basic user environment with minimal software available. The `module` system is a script-based system used to manage the user environment and to `activate` software packages. You must first load the corresponding software module to access software packages installed on RCC clusters. 

Basic `module` commands:

| Command  | Description | 
| --------- | --------- | 
| `module avail`          |   lists all available software modules            |    
| `module avail [name]`   |   lists modules matching [name]                   |
| `module load [name]`    |   loads the named module                          |
| `module unload [name]`  |   unloads the named module                        |
| `module list`           |   lists the modules currently loaded for the user |

!!! note "Module dependencies"
    Note that some modules require other specific modules, i.e., dependencies, to be loaded (or unloaded). If there is a conflict, you must explicitly unload the conflicting module (`module unload ...`), then load the desired module again. In certain cases, usually with loading an out-of-date module, you may get an error such as `Error: Requirement...` if a dependency is absent. In those situations, you can try `module load -f <module>` to force the module to load.

!!! note "Note on software for AMD CPUs" 
    For the `amd` partitions on Midway3, you need the software modules built specifically for AMD CPUs.
```
module use /software/modulefiles-amd
module list
```

## Requesting a software package installation 
If you need software not currently available in the module system and believe that multiple research groups can benefit from installing this software, send a detailed request to our [Help Desk](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/consulting-and-technical-support){:target='_blank'} providing:

1. Complete the name of the software package 
2. Exact version number 
3. Link to the package website 
4. Explain in a paragraph how this software is crucial for your research and having it on RCC clusters.
